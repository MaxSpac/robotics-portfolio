# CamJam Robot with Obstacle Avoidance

## Overview

This project showcases an autonomous robot built using the CamJam EduKit 3, designed to detect and avoid obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor. The robot is controlled via Python scripts running on a Raspberry Pi, demonstrating my growing skills in robotics and programming.

## Technologies

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, CamJam EduKit 3 Motors
- **Software**: Python 3, RPi.GPIO

## Objective

The robot autonomously navigates by detecting obstacles and adjusting its path, utilizing a state machine to manage states like "Drive," "Turn," and "Stop."

## Progress

This project marks my initial steps in robotics, building hands-on experience with hardware integration and Python programming. Key milestones include:

- **Setup**: Configured Raspberry Pi via ssh and ultrasonic sensor (Completed: 2025-04-19).
- **Basic Control**: Implemented motor control and sensor reading (Completed: 2025-04-20).
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Developed state machine for autonomous navigation (Completed: Expected 2025-04-20).
- **Future Goals**: Port the project to ROS for simulation in Gazebo and enhance with advanced sensors.

## Status

- **Current**: Basic obstacle avoidance implemented; refining state machine logic.
- **Next Steps**: Establish connection with smartphone to run certain scripts; integrate with ROS and simulate in Gazebo.

## Demo

Video and screenshots will be added upon completion of the state machine.
